# What is the Collatz Conjecture?

the collatz conjecture states that given any positive integer and applying the following rules:

if it's odd - multiply by 3 and add 1
if it's even - divide by 2

then the integer will end with a loop of 4->2->1->4...

it's a conjecture because it has not been solved yet, so these scripts try to test the conjecture

the python script is the simpler one, and the C script is the optimized one
