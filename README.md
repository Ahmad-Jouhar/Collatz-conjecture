# What is the Collatz Conjecture?

The Collatz conjecture states that given any positive integer and applying the following rules:
- If it's odd - multiply by 3 and add 1
- If it's even - divide by 2
Then the integer will end with a loop of 4->2->1->4...
It's a conjecture because it has not been solved yet, so these scripts try to test the conjecture

## Requirements:
- Python 3 (for the python script)
- A C compiler (gcc is pre-installed in linux)

The Python script is the simpler one, and the C script is the optimized one

## Extras:
- A java file that will run the code using 24 threads
- A python file that will run the code using millions of GPU threads using CUDA
- 2 additional versions of the code using functional and OOP programming methodologies
